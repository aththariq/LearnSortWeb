# LearnSortWeb

**LearnSortWeb** is an interactive educational web application designed to help users understand and master sorting algorithms through engaging visualizations. This application demonstrates various sorting algorithms such as *Bubble Sort*, *Merge Sort*, and *Quick Sort*. Users can adjust the size of the array and the speed of the visualization to observe how these factors affect the sorting process.

## Features
- **Interactive visualizations**: Displays popular sorting algorithms like *Bubble Sort*, *Merge Sort*, and *Quick Sort*.
- **Array size adjustment**: Allows users to modify the size of the array to be sorted.
- **Speed control**: A dynamic slider to adjust the speed of the sorting visualization.
- **Responsive design**: Optimized for various screen sizes, providing an adaptable user interface.
- **Operation controls**: Users can start, pause, and reset the sorting process with built-in controls.
- **Algorithm selection**: Dropdown menu to choose different sorting algorithms.

## Live Demo
You can try the app here: [LearnSortWeb on Vercel](https://learn-sort-web.vercel.app)

## Current Status
This project is still under active development, with some features and improvements being added gradually. Several updates will be rolled out over time to enhance functionality.

## Known Issues
- Some algorithm visualizations may not work as expected under certain conditions.
- Speed adjustments via the slider may not reflect immediately during the sorting process.
- UI/UX optimizations are ongoing.
- Additional sorting algorithms will be added in future updates.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** - For structuring the application.
- **CSS3** - For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** - For implementing sorting logic and DOM manipulation.
- **Vercel** - For hosting and deploying the application.
